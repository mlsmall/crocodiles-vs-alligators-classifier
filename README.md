# Crocodiles vs Alligators Classifier

This is a simple image classifier that can distinguish between alligators and crocodiles. After cleaning the data a bit and playing around with the learning rate, the accuracy turned out to be 86%. 

You can test it yourself in a web application I created here: https://zeit-wibwuxpygu.now.sh/. Just upload a picture of an alligator or a crocodile.
