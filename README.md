# Crocodiles vs Alligators Classifier

This is a simple image classifier that can distinguish between alligators and crocodiles. After cleaning the data a bit and playing around with the learning rate, the accuracy achieved was 86%. 

You can test it yourself in a web application I created here: https://croc-or-alli.herokuapp.com/. Just upload a picture of an alligator or a crocodile and the algorithm will tell you what it thinks and how confident it is with its prediction.
